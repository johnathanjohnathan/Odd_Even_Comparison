# Odd Even Comparison
### In this my first JavaScript Project I make a comparison between odd and even array
- First I generate a 100 random number between 1-50
- And then I seperate them into 2 array, first array with odd index and second array with even index
- After that I make a comparison for max, min, total, and mean between odd and even array using function
